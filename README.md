Story Creator - Add API


Story Creator is a web-based tool that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate short stories for children based on a prompt provided by the user. It also offers an illustration generation feature, which creates an image for the story in a style of your choice. This project serves as a creative resource for parents, teachers, and children to explore imaginative storytelling.

Features
Story Generation: Uses GPT-3.5 to generate short stories based on a user-provided prompt.
Illustration Generation: Generates a custom illustration for the story using OpenAI's image generation API.
RESTful API: Exposes an API to generate both stories and illustrations via POST requests.
Tech Stack
Backend: Flask
AI API: OpenAI (GPT-3.5 and DALL-E for image generation)
Environment Management: python-dotenv
Dependencies: Python, Flask, OpenAI, dotenv, requests, PIL (Python Imaging Library)
